## Project 1: Where to bet?
#### Where do you get the best odds if you would like to bet on your favourite boxing match? <br>
In this webscraping project I compared the betting odds from four different betting websites. I specifically looked at boxing events. I used selenium and bs4 to scrape the desired information from the different websites. Using selfmade functions I paired the corresponding boxing events from the different websites. Then comparing the different odds and returning a table displaying all the upcoming boxing events with their best odds and on which website you can find these odds.  <br>

The main packages I used were: bs4, selenium and pandas. <br>
